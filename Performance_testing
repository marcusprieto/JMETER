Main task workflows
	Steps to get a functionality hoped
	Examples:
		Performance Logging in fluig's interface
		Complete sign in test about how it's possible in a time range   
		Performance when the consumer access the fluig identity
	        Performance about management content with ECM product
			
By user types
#Examples
	Teste de consulta
	Teste para geração de relatorios
	Teste de cadastro de produto
	
#Performance testing theory:
  	Operations exetuted #Example: Selecting a product to buy
	Parameters	    #Example: delay 2 seconds to select		
	Timers		    #Example: Max.resp.time 5 seconds	


Response Time (High or low response)
Latency (softwares or network)
Render time (depends the client aplication that you use)
Maximum concurrent VU (How many concurrent users the system be able to support) 
Throughtput (it meant high performance)	

##############################
Types of Performance testing #
##############################

	Load test
		Fixed number of concurrent VU
		Fixed iterations of business transactions OR fixed duration
		Also called performance test, reabilitty test and volume test

	Stress Test
		Extreme load until system failure
		Increasing number of concurrent VU or test data or throughtput
		Continous business transactions iterations
		Used for benchmarking and finding bottlenecks
		Also called Torture Test

	Endurance Test (Soak Test)
		Expected load for long duration
		Fixed number of concurrent VU
		Continuous test
	

Performance Testing Process

	Test Script Modeling --> Teste Data Prep --> Test Modeling

Test Environment Preparation #
##############################

	Isolated / test run during off-hours
	Dedicated
	Powerful enough load generators	
	Must be a realistic production like environment

	Types - Status Report and Final Report
	Contains sections
		Executive summary
		Performance test approach
		Test scripts, test data and test environment
		Test Results
			- Benchmarks
			- Suggested actions
		Supporting Data

To start:

Clique com o botão direito no test plan, add, thread users, thread group
Clique sobre o projeto, add, sampler, http request

Configuration test:
Number of threads (users) - Número de usuários que irão fazer as requisições
Ramp-up period (in seconds) - Quantas requisições
Loop Count: Quantas vezes será feita a requisição por usuário



Graph Results
- No of samples -> number of Jmeter's response
